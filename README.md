# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to examine past kickstarter data upon various metrics in order to best determine the facets of a successful kickstarter.
## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

By taking data from the various outcomes of the kickstarters, a relationship could be formed between the time of the year that the kickstarters were held and the number of successful, failed, or cancelled kickstarters.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

In this visualization, the outcomes of theater-specific kickstarters were examined against various dollar amount goal thresholds to identify how many failed, succeeded, or were eventually cancelled for each goal amount.
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The biggest challenge encountered during this project involved the processing and filtering of the data (due it's size) in a form that could be translated into proper graphs/visualizations. This challenge was mainly overcome with the learning of pivot tables and pivot charts to more efficiently organize data and filter what specific data that would be analyzed. By having control of the various criteria that the dataset recorded, it was much easier to establish relationships between the various factors and create meaningful graphs/charts.
## Results
Based on this visualization of the data for the various outcomes for theater kickstarters based on launch date, the time of the year with the most successful kickstarters peaks around May. Additionally, two smaller peaks in successful kickstarters happen around February and October. Although May indicates the time of the most succesful kickstarters, it also indicates some of the highest amounts of failed kickstarters. This likely indicates that in May, the greatest amount of kickstarters are started/finished.
In the data visualization of the Outcomes of kickstarters vs goals, the greatest percentage of successful kickstarters occurs around the $1,000 - $5,000 range along with the $35,000 - $45,000 for the more expensive kickstarters. One thing to note is around the $45,000 - $50,000 range, just about every kickstarter failed, with only a slight decrease in failures when kickstarter goals exceed $50,000+.
Although this dataset provides a lot of insight on potential connections on outcomes based on goals and launch date, this can only be plausibly related, without assurance of causation. That is to say, there is no way to confirm that the reasons that these kickstarters ended with their corresponding outcome only due to these features alone. Much more data would need to be collected in different criteria to properly determine what exactly determines the outcomes of these kickstarters.
Additional graphs or tables to be explored could include pledged amounts vs initial goal amounts and the outcomes of those various kickstarters, or finding out which kickstarters are more popular within certain areas of the world vs others.
