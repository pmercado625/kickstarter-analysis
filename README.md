# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Taking data from failed, successful, and cancelled kickstarters to plan for new projects!

Generally, smaller scale projects are more likely to succeed and gather crowdfunding. In addition, the theater category of kickstarters tend to be more successful and raise more money so that's good news! Just make sure you start around the June/July months of the year as those tend to be the months that people receive the most support.

Good luck!
